Archlinux ARM Pi Installer
==========================

This tool aims to ease the creation of an Archlinux ARM storage media for
Raspberry Pi devices.

It also provides an easy way to create raw image files that can then be
used with [QEMU](https://www.qemu.org/).

> **Note:** Only Raspberry Pi 1 & 2 are supported at the moment but new
  profiles can easily be created in the dedicated folder `profiles/`, as
  long as the steps stay similar.
